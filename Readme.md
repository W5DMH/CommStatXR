CommstatX is a Python version of the CommStat software designed to run on Linux(windows X version coming soon) 
Download the archive, unarchive it into the folder commstatx and run install.py 

probably best to update python a bit before starting: <br>
<b>in a terminal type : python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip </b>

when the above command completes, make sure you are in the commstatx folder and then : <br>
<b>type: Python3 install.py </b>

After a successful install (this installs all of the necessary Python modules) 

<b>type: python3 commstatx.py</b>    

you should see a settings window that must be populated with a callsign, and a path to the 
JS8Call log directory (use JS8Call "LOG" menu item and "Open Log Directory" to get the path and
make sure there is in fact a DIRECTED.TXT file there ....the path should be something 
like /home/dan/.local/share/JS8Call    do not enter the trailing slash or the file name. 

After that is complete you should be able to run CommStatx by retyping:<br>
<b> type : python3 commstatx.py </b>
<br>
